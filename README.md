Hi, I’m @luke-fitzsimmons
I’m interested in Python development and writing tools to retrieve, process and convert information.
I'm gradually improving my coding as I continue to write code, working currently on a project to retrieve recipes from popular sites and convert the ingredients from varied measures to grams.
